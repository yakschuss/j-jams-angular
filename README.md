## Configuration

Install the project dependencies by running:

```
$ npm install
```

## Run the Application

Run the application using the Gruntfile's `default` task:

```
$ grunt
```

The default task runs a simple server on port 3000. To view it in a any browser, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
All code, styles, markup, and assets should be saved to the `app` directory. Saving changes creates a new directory, `dist`, that holds final copies of the application content. `dist` is the directory the server uses to serve the content displayed by the browser. __Do not edit files in `dist`__ because it will reset changes to your work every time you save. Restrict all edits to files in the `app` directory.
